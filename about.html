<h2>Middle School</h2>

<p>Ever since middle school, when I became involved in a robotics team, I've loved software and programming. Initially, I loved programming because you could fix problems in a program much easier than a robot, which the team would have to completly tear down to correct even the slightest problems. For three years, I programmed for the team and developed their WordPress website, gaining great experience with HTML and CSS.</p>

<h2>High School Experiences</h2>

<p>As I entered <a href="http://www.onwravens.net/">Olathe Northwest High School</a>, the first activity I joined was <a href="http://www.kshsaa.org/Public/ScholarsBowl/Main.cfm">Scholars' Bowl</a>, a competition where teams from two different schools compete to answer questions about academic subjects quickly and accurately. There, I found the first group in high school that I <i>fit</i> with. Despite having a different sponsor all four years I was involved in the program, the students in Scholars' Bowl combined and collaborated to keep the program running. During senior year, through the combined efforts of our new sponsor, myself, as President, and the entire team, we went to and won the <a href="http://www.kshsaa.org/Public/ScholarsBowl/Champs18.cfm">Kansas Scholars' Bowl 6A State Championship</a>. Scholars' Bowl taught me how to lead well, whether winning or losing, how to support my teammates in any activity, and, most importantly, the value of perseverance.</p>

<p>In my sophomore year of high school, I joined debate, and I also joined forensics in my junior year. I specialized in traditional policy debate, congressional debate, and informational speaking during my time in debate and forensics. These classes and activities also introduced me to many great people who I built strong friendshps with. In senior year, my partner and I finished with a winning record at the <a href="https://www.tabroom.com/index/tourn/results/event_results.mhtml?tourn_id=7992&result_id=55402">Kansas Debate Classic</a>, the premier traditional debate tournament in Kansas, and I finished sixth out of 100 congressional debaters at the East Kansas National Qualifier for Congressional Debate. Debate and forensics taught me so much more than how to win or lose well. They also deepened my research skills and throughly honed my presentation and speaking skills, allowing me to pursuade and inform in almost any setting.</p>

<p>In high school, I also continued to program and explore my interests in engineering and application development. Throughout high school, I was involved in the Engineering Academy, a four-year pre-professional training program. The program taught me all about the engineering design process and reintroduced me to robotics, through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Tech_Challenge">FIRST Tech Challenge</a> (FTC). In junior year, I programmed for my FTC team using a varient of Java, and, in senior year, led the team as the Operations Manager, managing finances, the engineering notebook, and team media. I also took classes in Java, Android Development, and Web Design during high school. In my final year of high school, I also began developing an Android application for the technology site <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Technica">Ars Technica</a>, which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/awbooze/AndroidTechnica">my GitHub</a>. Through these projects, I kept my programming skills fresh and up-to-date.</p>

<h2>Work Experiences</h2>

<p>I also completed two internships in the summers of my junior and senior years. After my junior year of high school, I worked for a small Kansas City-area startup named <a href="https://helmettracker.com/">Helmet Tracker</a>. There, I collected helmet images and contact information for over 700 colleges and universities to enable a national helmet contest called Helmet Bowl I. I also collaborated with the Helmet Tracker team to design and implement the contest's voting system, which handled over 250,000 votes across all conferences in Helmet Bowl I.</p>

<p>After my senior year, I was employed in a very different position: Sign Enforcement Officer for the <a href="https://www.olatheks.org/">City of Olathe</a>. In this position, I worked independently to enforce sign codes by removing temporary signage in city rights-of-way and reporting larger signs to my colleagues. I removed over 450 small signs during my time in this position.</p>

<h2>College</h2>

<p>As I move into college, I am majoring in computer science, but I am not sure what activities I will continue doing for all four years. I am currently trying out many clubs and opportunities to find the best fit for me and my schedule. Now, I love application development: not only for how easy iteration is, but how it can be applied to so many impactful applications, including this website.</p>
