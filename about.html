<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
    I'm a student at Kansas State University majoring in Computer Science with 
    a minor in Political Science. I am on track to graduate in May 2022 and am
    seeking employment in the computer science field.
</p>

<h2>What am I passionate about?</h2>
<p>
    Ever since middle school, when I participated in a robotics team, I've
    loved software and programming. Since then, I've been fortunate to be able
    to pursue that passion, including by attending K-State!
    Programming excites me because it draws on my logic and detail skills to
    solve difficult problems that can affect anywhere from one person to 
    billions of people.
</p>
<p>
    A twin passion has grown up alongside programming, however: reducing

        political
    </a>
    <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/">
        polarization 
    </a>
    in the United States by promoting the practice of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith">
        assuming good faith</a>. 
    This desire has informed my engagement in campus politics throughout my 
    time at K-State and I would love to pursue it alongside programming as I 
    move beyond my education.
</p>

<h2>What are my previous work experiences?</h2>
<p>
    After my junior year of high school, I worked for a small Kansas City-area 
    startup named <a href="https://helmettracker.com/">Helmet Tracker</a>. There, 
    I collected helmet images and contact information for over 700 colleges and
    universities to enable a national helmet contest called Helmet Bowl. I 
    also collaborated with the Helmet Tracker team to design and implement the 
    contest's voting system in WordPress, which handled over 250,000 votes 
    across all conferences during the first Helmet Bowl.
</p>
<p>
    After my freshman year of college, I worked for 
    <a href="https://www.rsa.com">RSA Security</a> on the 
    <a href="https://www.archerirm.com">RSA Archer Suite</a> at their Overland 
    Park office. During my internship, I worked on the server side of the Archer 
    Suite implementing REST API endpoints in C#. Those endpoints enabled the 
    creation of an entirely new navigation menu for the application, which 
    <a href="https://community.rsa.com/t5/archer-blog/improved-user-experience-with-rsa-archer-6-7/ba-p/520852">
        was implemented in RSA Archer version 6.7
    </a>
    and is currently used by 
    <a href="https://www.archerirm.com/customers">over 1,300 organizations</a>.
</p>
<p>
    After my sophomore year of college, I worked for 
    <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/">Garmin International</a> at their 
    main office in Olathe, Kansas. As a Software Engineer Intern, I worked on 
    <a href="https://fly.garmin.com/fly-garmin/">flyGarmin</a>, Garmin's
    web-based portal for pilot avionic databases, registration, and product 
    support. During my time at Garmin, I repaired unit tests in Scala for use in
    continuous integration and wrote Angular
    services, components, and unit tests in TypeScript to connect with new 
    flyGarmin APIs. While not all of my changes have shipped to customers, they 
    provided the foundation for improved development practices and a 
    next-generation version of flyGarmin.
</p>

<h2>What am I involved in at K-State?</h2>
<p>
    In April, I began my third term as a Student Senator for K-State's
    <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/sga/">
        Student Governing Association
    </a> (SGA).
    SGA Student Senate allocates almost $16 million of privilege fee funding 
    between different organizations on campus, including the Union, Recreational 
    Services, Lafene Health Center, and more. SGA also allots a piece of that 
    money to fund travel and on-campus events for registered student organizations and
    advocates for topics of interest to students to administration and at all
    levels of government. SGA has been a great way for me to use the Speech and 
    Debate skills I developed during high school to serve students.
</p>
<p>
    I've also consistently participated in the
    <a href="http://mdc.cs.ksu.edu">
        Mobile Development Club
    </a>
    at Kansas State University and am currently its president. In this role, I 
    lead Android application development tutorials for a small group of students
    as well as handle administrative tasks for the club.
</p>

<h2>What are some awards I've received?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Elected to Student Senate by College of Engineering peers for three years in a row</li>
    <li>KSU SGA Outstanding Achievement Award - April 2021</li>
    <li>Residence Hall Student of the Year - April 2020</li>

    <li>Scholars' Bowl State Champion - February 2018</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do I do in my free time?</h2>
<p>
    I can often be found playing board, computer, or role-playing games and 
    reading novels, non-fiction, or news articles. I spend additional time 
    experimenting with 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">
        constructed languages</a>, 
    outlining novels, reading and editing Wikipedia, spending time with 
    family, and more!
